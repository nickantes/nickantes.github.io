# Why BLOC?

It all started when a friend wanted to show me a little bit of JavaScript. After that I knew that that was what I wanted to do for a living. The idea that I could work with computers, have a great home/work balance and make decent money, no brainer right?! Well its never that easy, in fact its a lot of confusing and frustrating work and a constant struggle to find time. Its not all doom and gloom though I have been learning a lot and that makes it fun and interesting so it has all been worth it and for the better. This is a little bit rambley so I think I will just cut it short.

```
    function doStuff(){
        return "stuff done";
    }
```
