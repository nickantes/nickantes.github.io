# My Family Trip To AZ

My family and I went to Arizona this weekend to visit my Mom, step dad, and aunt (as well as the family dogs!). They had just moved out there not to long ago and it was our first time seeing their new place. It was really nice, kind of rural but that's kind of how they are. My step dad has golf carts for them and the dogs to ride around their one and a half acker property. He has car lifts and old muscle car projects laying around and my mom has the inside of the house decorated just like a magazine. Its kind of how we always imagined they would live, quaint but extravagant in their own sort of ways. It was good to see them again and get that "home feeling" again. They absolutely love scarlett and of course she loves them right back. We all had a wonderful time and look forward to the next time I can get off of work to take us back out for more fun. (next time we can take the jeep) Did I mention they are only 20minutes from Laughlin?! Location location location they say! Because that alone we will have to be back soon!
