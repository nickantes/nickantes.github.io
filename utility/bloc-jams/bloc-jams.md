# Bloc Jams

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Music player for all

Bloc jams is a basic, user-friendly music playing app

## What is Bloc Jams?

Bloc jams is essentially made up of mostly vanilla JavaScript. With some JQuery and DOM manipulation, as well as some simple html and css on top of it all. I wanted to create and app that was user-friendly and could switch audio files on the fly. Wile keeping track of play times and reporting them back to the user. If you stopped a song and came back, I wanted it to pick up where you had left off.

## Why Bloc Jams?

I wanted to learn what it took to make my idea of a user-friendly but complex music player come to life. I knew it would be a great way to hone my skills in JavaScript and further my learning process, as well as be super convenient for playing all my music.

## Was it worth it?

I spent months learning what it took to make this final outcome look the way it does now. I am proud of what it came to be of all the hard work and frustration. I am able to play audio files and keep track of what spot I am in the audio files. This allows me to switch songs and never miss a beat (or hear it all over again).

## What did Bloc Jams become?

A fully functional music app! You can manipulate audio files via JavaScript all from the beautiful view of the apps player, what more could you want?

## What was the biggest help in making Bloc Jams?

Ultimately the help from my Bloc mentors was the best advice I could hope for. They kept me on track and made sure any questions I had where not really road blocks, just more things to learn. learning how to use libraries made life easier to an extent. A lot of the methods I learned seemed to be the "Long way" to get things done. But I am glad in the end i was able to learn the techniques required to make an app of this caliber.
